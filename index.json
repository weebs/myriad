By meta-programming in F# I mean generating actual F# code like discriminated unions and records, not just IL output.\r\n\r\nMyriad is an evolution of the ideas I developed while working with F#'s type providers and other meta-programming functionality like quotations and AST manipulation. Myriad aims to make it easy to extend the compiler via Myriad plugins rather than modifying or adjusting Type Providers and other F# improvement that would be a long time to be developed and released.  The idea is you write a Myriad plugin that works on a fragment of AST input, and the plugin supplies AST output with the final form being source code that is built into your project.  Thus the compiler can optimise and tooling can operate effectively too."},{"uri":"https://moiraesoftware.github.io/myriad//how-tos/du-extensions.html","title":"DU Extensions","content":"\r\nThe input file in this example `Library.fs` looks like this:\r\n\r\n```fsharp\r\nnamespace Example\r\nopen Myriad.Plugins\r\n\r\n[<Generator.DuCases>]\r\ntype Currency =\r\n| CAD\r\n| PLN\r\n| EUR\r\n| USD\r\n| Custom of string\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn attribute is used by the plugin so that the code generator plugin knows which parts of the input AST are to be used by the plugin.
